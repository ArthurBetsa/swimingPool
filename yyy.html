this story is not about my hobby, not about my plans for the future, or about the outgoing school year. there will
probably be fewer jokes here. no matter how much I want to enter adulthood with a positive, sadness and longing will not
be able to leave me. I am not afraid of this loud word, but you have become very close to me during these 8 years, which
flew by like an instant. I cannot speak beautifully, and words cannot describe my gratitude.
gratitude for every word, for every rule, for the times that we have been chewing for 8 years and I am still a little
confused, for your nerves of steel and strong patience. thank you for your professionalism.
I am grateful to you for the knowledge that will stay with me for the rest of my life. there is nothing more expensive
than this. Thank you for putting your soul into our lessons, sharing your experience with me. I will remember this until
I forget how to speak English (remember forever)


I wish you have pupils like me. only there is one but. I wish they wonâ€™t wake up from your call with the words "have you
forgotten that we have a lesson?"
